Welcome! I'm Sean 👋. I hold a PhD in Data Science 🎓 from the New Jersey Institute of Technology, where I worked under Professor Yi Chen. My doctoral research developed end-to-end machine learning pipelines for healthcare applications ❤️, with a focus on leveraging AI to improve patient engagement efficiency and outcomes.

I have industry and research experience across both academia and large-scale technology organizations 💼. In 2022, I interned as a Data Scientist at Amazon's Supply Chain Optimization Technologies (SCOT) 📦. In 2021, I was an AI Research Associate at the Center for Health Information & Decision Systems (CHIDS), University of Maryland 🔬.

Before pursuing my PhD, I earned an M.S. from Fordham University and a B.S. from the New York Institute of Technology 📚, where I built a strong foundation in data science, analytics, and computational methods for large-scale business and information systems.

🔬 Research Experience
------
As a Research Assistant at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, I led multiple projects applying machine learning 🤖, deep learning, and natural language processing to healthcare data 📊. My work included developing a knowledge graph–enhanced thread recommender system for online health forums 💬, designing graph-based and hybrid models to improve patient reachability and call-time prediction 📞, and creating a hybrid NLP framework with a prototype system for extracting cancer biomarkers from pathology reports 🧬. I also developed a hierarchical time-aware neural network for personalized adverse drug event risk prediction using claims data ⚕️, and contributed to advanced deep learning methods for extracting patient conditions from clinical notes.

👨‍🏫 Teaching Experience
------
At the New Jersey Institute of Technology, I served as Instructor for courses in project management and decision support systems 📋, and as Teaching Assistant for courses in project management, database systems 🗄️, and business analytics 📈. My responsibilities included full course instruction, technical support for project management software (Microsoft Project) 💻, and assisting with lab sessions in analytics and database technologies.
