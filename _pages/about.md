Welcome! I'm Xiangyu (you can also call me Sean), a Ph.D. candidate in Data Science at New Jersey Institute of Technology. Over the past few years, I have participated in multiple projects that develop end-to-end data mining and machine learning systems for healthcare applications. From these projects, I have accumulated extensive experience in various data science tasks, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, information extraction, and natural language processing. I am highly proficient in Python and R and have considerable SQL and SAS experience. In the summer of 2022, I interned as a Data Scientist at [Amazon’s Supply Chain Optimization Technologies (SCOT)](https://www.amazon.science/tag/supply-chain-optimization-technologies). In the summer of 2021, I worked as an AI Research Associate at [the Center for Health Information & Decision Systems (CHIDS), University of Maryland](https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/centers/chids).

I’m currently seeking a full-time DS/MLE/Applied Scientist position.
