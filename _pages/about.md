Welcome! I’m Xiangyu (Sean). I hold a PhD in Data Science from the New Jersey Institute of Technology, where I worked under Professor Yi Chen. My doctoral research developed end-to-end machine learning pipelines for healthcare applications, with a focus on leveraging AI to improve patient engagement efficiency and outcomes.

I have industry and research experience across both academia and large-scale technology organizations. In 2022, I interned as a Data Scientist at Amazon’s Supply Chain Optimization Technologies (SCOT). In 2021, I was an AI Research Associate at the Center for Health Information & Decision Systems (CHIDS), University of Maryland.

Before pursuing my PhD, I earned an M.S. from Fordham University and a B.S. from the New York Institute of Technology, where I built a strong foundation in data science, analytics, and computational methods for large-scale business and information systems.

<!--I’m currently seeking a full-time DS/MLE/Applied Scientist position.-->
